To run our code:

Go to the downloaded directory and run python main.py
In the command line, you can enter the amount of nodes you want to see (up to 100,000)
Then click on two nodes, the first node would be the starting point and the second node would be the destination. 
After selecting two notes click on the algorihtm you wish to use - Dijkstra's or A*.
The clear button would clear the path and you can select two new nodes. 
The reset button would generate a new graph based on the amount of nodes you have inputted.
